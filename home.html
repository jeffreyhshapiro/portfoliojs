		<h3>About me</h3>
			<p> I am a New Jersey native who went to school for science and a passion for technology.  I am currently working in a lab for a global pharmaceutical company but would truly enjoy using my skills as a dev to contribute to the advancement of a science or healthcare startup.  
			<br>
			<br>
			I have always been interested in technology and fascinated by how the right innovation has the potential to immensely improve our lives.  This <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ted.com/talks/jorge_soto_the_future_of_early_cancer_detection?language=en">TED Talk</a> about early cancer detection is a great blend of science and technology that planted the seeds for me to consider development as a career.
			<br>
			<br>
			I enjoy spending time outdoors, especially hiking, biking, or kayaking.  I even did a few <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/iduOlwj.jpg">mud races</a> this past year.
			</p>
