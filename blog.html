			<section>After almost two years of dabbling in code, I finally dove right in with Rutgers Coding Bootcamp.  So far it has been a great experience because we are empowered to write code from day 1, where we began building our portfolios using some HTML.  HTML is the perfect way to foray into the world of coding and learn it means to think like a developer, from solving problems on your own or going to the online community for guidance.  The bootcamp is showing itself tough to balance with work, but I will surely manage.  It does feel good to be sitting back in a Rutgers classroom.</section>
